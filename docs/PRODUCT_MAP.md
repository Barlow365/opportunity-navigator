# CANONICAL PRODUCT TRUTH (NO-DRIFT)
The system is THREE-LAYER.

1) LAYER 1 (AI Navigator) provides CLARITY with zero risk.
   - Conversational UI helps users find resources.
   - Max 5 clarifying questions, honest timelines (2-6 weeks typical).
   - Identifies gaps and opens door to Layer 2.

2) LAYER 2 (Community Bridge) provides IMMEDIACY with low risk.
   - Request form for short-term needs ($10-$25, 48-72h).
   - Helper matching algorithm (geography + capacity).
   - Four forms of help: Time, Items, Cash, Access.
   - Helper agency: form, visibility, expectation.

3) LAYER 3 (Continuity Reserve) is LAST RESORT with tight control.
   - Very small amounts ($10-$25 max).
   - One active use at a time.
   - Only when community matching fails (24h elapsed).
   - No interest, no fees.

4) COMMUNITY CREDIT is the GLUE.
   - Private score tracking capacity extended + reliability demonstrated.
   - Unlocks priority matching, longer windows, fewer cooldowns.
   - Never public, never leaderboards, never flexing.

Terminology rules:
- Continuity Reserve is NOT a loan. It's a micro-credit safety net.
- Community Credit is PRIVATE (no public scores).
- Helpers have AGENCY (choose form, visibility, expectation).
- No predatory fees, no public shaming, no hidden terms.
